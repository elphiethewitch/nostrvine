## Project Notes

## OpenVine Mobile: PR5 Router-Driven HomeScreen Foundation Complete

**Status:** Foundation complete, feature flag added, all tests passing

**Architecture Decision:** Clean room implementation approach
- Built fresh `home_screen_router.dart` from scratch
- Kept legacy `video_feed_screen.dart` unchanged (no migration yet)
- Feature flag `routerDrivenHome` controls cutover
- Incremental feature addition strategy proven

**Test Strategy Validated:**
- TDD works perfectly for router-driven widgets
- Mock providers with simple data structures
- Test URL ↔ UI synchronization bidirectionally
- Verify lifecycle cleanliness (no mutations during dispose)

**Provider Pattern:**
- Route-aware providers select data based on route type
- Controller providers handle side effects (pagination, refresh)
- UI is pure presentation - no business logic
- Feature flag defaults to false (safe rollout)

**Critical Files for Future PRs:**
- `lib/screens/home_screen_router.dart` - Reference implementation
- `test/screens/home_screen_router_test.dart` - Test pattern template
- `lib/providers/route_feed_providers.dart` - Feed selector pattern
- `lib/providers/home_screen_controllers.dart` - Controller pattern

## Project Notes

**Fixed: Videos Playing When Not Visible**

Root cause: Two systems competing to control active video:
- VideoPageView (parent, correct authority)
- VideoFeedItem VisibilityDetector (child, causing conflicts)

Fix: Removed setActiveVideo() from VideoFeedItem's VisibilityDetector callback. VideoPageView is now the single source of truth.

Files modified:
- `lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart` - Removed setActiveVideo from VisibilityDetector callback
- `lib/widgets/video_page_view.dart` - Added app foreground checks to all setActiveVideo calls

Architecture principle: Parent components control state, children react to state. Don't have competing state setters.

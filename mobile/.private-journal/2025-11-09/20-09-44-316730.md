## Project Notes

Geo-blocker worker deployed successfully at https://openvine-geo-blocker.protestnet.workers.dev

Test shows it's working - detected my location as Spain (ES, Catalonia), not blocked. 

For Mississippi users, they'll get:
- HTTP 451 status
- blocked: true
- region: "MS"
- reason: "Age verification laws..."

Ready to integrate into Flutter app now.

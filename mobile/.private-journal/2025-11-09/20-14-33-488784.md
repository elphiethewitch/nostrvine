## Project Notes

Geo-blocking implementation complete:

Files created:
- ../geo-blocker/ - Cloudflare Worker (deployed to protestnet.workers.dev)
- lib/services/geo_blocking_service.dart - Flutter service with caching
- lib/screens/geo_blocked_screen.dart - Dark mode block screen
- lib/widgets/geo_blocking_gate.dart - App wrapper widget

Files modified:
- lib/constants/app_constants.dart - Added geo-blocking config
- lib/providers/app_providers.dart - Added geoBlockingServiceProvider
- lib/main.dart - Wrapped app with GeoBlockingGate

Ready to test on macOS build. Should see loading spinner then proceed to app (not in Mississippi).

To test Mississippi block: would need VPN or modify worker to always return blocked=true.

## Project Notes

Adding GeoIP-based state blocking for Mississippi age verification law compliance. This will be a passive IP check, no device location permissions needed. Need to:
1. Choose GeoIP service (ipapi.co, ip-api.com, or MaxMind)
2. Add backend endpoint to check IP location (Cloudflare Workers can see client IP)
3. Add Flutter service to call check on app startup
4. Show block screen if Mississippi detected
5. Cache result to avoid repeated checks

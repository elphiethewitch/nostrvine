## Project Notes

## Apple App Store Compliance Fixes Complete (Nov 6, 2025)

Successfully implemented all 4 fixes for Apple rejection:

**COMPLETED:**
1. ✅ Removed background audio keys from Info.plist (AVInitialRouteSharingPolicy, AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback)
2. ✅ Added TOS acceptance + age verification (16+) to WelcomeScreen with clickable links
3. ✅ Documented 24-hour moderation response process (MODERATION_RESPONSE_PROCESS.md)
4. ✅ Created comprehensive Apple review response (APPLE_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md)

**IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:**
- WelcomeScreen now requires 2 checkboxes before signup:
  - "I am 16 years or older"
  - "I agree to Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Safety Standards"
- Signup buttons disabled until both checked
- Links open in external browser
- Acceptance stored with timestamp in SharedPreferences
- Dark mode styling with VineTheme.vineGreen accents

**EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE (already built):**
- ContentReportingService with 9 report categories
- ContentModerationService with multi-layer filtering
- Block/mute functionality in share menu and profiles
- NIP-56 reporting via Nostr events
- Safety Settings screen

**COMMIT:** 4350a2d "fix(apple): implement App Store review compliance fixes"

**REMAINING:**
- ⚠️ MUST deploy TOS/Privacy/Safety pages to divine.video (currently 404)
- ⚠️ MUST upload real iPad screenshots to App Store Connect (can't verify without access)
- Note: Bluetooth background modes are NOT declared (false alarm from Apple)

## Project Notes

ExploreScreen navigation bug fixed by removing async setState race condition. The hashtag loading no longer interferes with video navigation. Important to remember that the explore screen uses TWO different GoRouter routes with different Navigator keys, which causes full widget recreation during navigation.

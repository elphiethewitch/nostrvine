## Project Notes

## Apple App Store Review Evaluation (Nov 6, 2025)

Reviewed Rabble's fixes against Apple's rejection:

**FINDINGS:**
1. ❌ **Audio Background Mode NOT FIXED**: Still has `AVInitialRouteSharingPolicy` and `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback` in Info.plist (lines 7-10)
2. ✅ **Bluetooth Background Mode**: Correctly NOT declared in UIBackgroundModes
3. ⚠️ **iPad Screenshots**: Can't verify without App Store Connect access
4. ❌ **Terms of Service/EULA**: NO terms acceptance in app - Apple requires users to agree to content policy
5. ✅ **Content Filtering**: ContentBlocklistService implemented
6. ✅ **Report Mechanism**: Full NIP-56 reporting with UI (share_video_menu.dart:1671+)
7. ✅ **Block User**: Block functionality in share menu and profile screen
8. ❓ **24-hour Response**: No documented process - needs procedural docs

**CRITICAL MISSING:**
- No Terms of Service / EULA acceptance flow
- No explicit "no objectionable content" policy shown to users
- Need to remove audio playback keys from Info.plist

**ARCHITECTURE NOTE:**
- Excellent moderation system architecture (MODERATION_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Uses Nostr NIP-56 (kind 1984) for reports
- Stackable moderation layers (built-in safety, personal filters, subscribed moderators, community signals)
- Report categories: spam, harassment, violence, sexual content, copyright, false info, CSAM, AI-generated, other

## Project Notes

ExploreScreen now properly derives its feed/grid mode from the URL using pageContextProvider instead of internal state. This fixes the navigation bug where switching to feed mode would fail on first tap because widget recreation lost the state. The URL is now the single source of truth, following Flutter Navigation 2.0 best practices.

## Project Notes

## Content Moderation UX Improvement - Report/Block Confirmation

**Problem**: After reporting content or blocking users, the UI would close dialogs and leave users on a blank/black screen with no confirmation or guidance.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Created _ReportConfirmationDialog** in `share_video_menu.dart`:
   - Shows success message: "Report Received"
   - Thanks user for helping keep diVine safe
   - Explains team will review and take action
   - Includes clickable link to `divine.video/safety` with visual indicator
   - Uses proper dark mode theming (VineTheme colors)

2. **Created _BlockConfirmationDialog** in `profile_screen_router.dart`:
   - Shows success message: "User Blocked"
   - Explains what blocking means (won't see content in feeds)
   - Reminds users they can unblock from profile or Settings > Safety
   - Same safety link with consistent styling

3. **Updated Report Flow**:
   - Both full report dialog and quick AI report now show confirmation
   - Replaced simple snackbars with rich confirmation dialogs
   - Added url_launcher import to share_video_menu.dart
   - Error cases still show snackbars (appropriate for failures)

4. **Updated Block User Flow**:
   - After blocking confirmation, shows success dialog instead of just snackbar
   - Added url_launcher import to profile_screen_router.dart
   - Unblock still uses simple snackbar (no need for confirmation there)

**Design Pattern**:
- Both dialogs use consistent structure:
  - Green checkmark icon + title
  - Primary message
  - Secondary explanation text
  - Interactive link card with green border
  - "Learn More" label with divine.video/safety URL
  - Open in external browser icon
  - Single "Close" button

**Testing**:
- Existing tests pass (share_video_menu_comprehensive_test.dart: 18/18)
- Flutter analyze shows no new issues from these changes
- Integration tests exist but need device to run

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart`: Added _ReportConfirmationDialog, updated _submitReport and quick AI report
- `mobile/lib/screens/profile_screen_router.dart`: Added _BlockConfirmationDialog, updated _blockUser

**UX Improvement**: Users now get clear feedback after taking safety actions, plus access to more information about safety policies. No more confusing blank screens.

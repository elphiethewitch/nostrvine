## Project Notes

## Flag Icon Fix - Size and Clickability

**Problem**: User reported flag icon was too small and not clickable.

**Root Cause**:
- Icon was 18px instead of 32px (other action buttons are 32px)
- Icon was a plain `Icon` widget, not wrapped in `IconButton`
- No label below icon (other buttons have labels like "Share")

**Solution**:
- Changed icon size from 18px to 32px
- Wrapped in `IconButton` with onPressed handler
- Added "Report" label below icon to match pattern
- Updated test from expect 18.0 to expect 32.0

**Pattern Learned**: When adding action buttons to video overlay:
1. Use IconButton, not plain Icon
2. Size should be 32px to match existing buttons
3. Add label below with text shadows for readability
4. Use Column layout with SizedBox spacing

**Commit**: 283a1bd "fix(moderation): make flag icon properly sized and clickable"

**Files Changed**:
- lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart - Changed implementation
- test/widgets/video_feed_item_moderation_icon_test.dart - Updated test

## Project Notes

## Content Moderation UX Reconnaissance

Found comprehensive backend services already implemented:

**Existing Services:**
1. **ContentModerationService** - Full NIP-51 mute list support with:
   - Multiple filter reasons (spam, harassment, violence, sexual content, CSAM, etc.)
   - Severity levels (info, warning, hide, block)
   - Mute lists (local + subscribeable external lists)
   - Keyword, pubkey, event, content-type filtering
   
2. **ContentReportingService** - NIP-56 compliant reporting (kind 1984):
   - Full Apple App Store compliance
   - Report content for violations
   - Report users for harassment
   - Quick report function
   - Local history tracking
   
3. **MuteService** - NIP-51 kind 10000 support:
   - Mute users (pubkeys)
   - Mute hashtags
   - Mute keywords/phrases
   - Mute threads
   - Temporary or permanent mutes
   - Publishes to Nostr
   
4. **ContentBlocklistService** - Internal blocklist:
   - Hardcoded + runtime blocking
   - Feed filtering
   - Stats tracking

**UX Gap Identified:**
The backend is FULLY IMPLEMENTED but there's NO UI to expose these features! The settings screen doesn't have moderation options, and video feed items don't have obvious report/block actions.

Need to find if ShareVideoMenu has anything, then synthesize findings.

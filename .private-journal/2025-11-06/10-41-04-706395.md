## Project Notes

**Hashtag Loading Performance Issue - Root Cause Found**

The "Loading hashtags..." appearing slow is actually caused by TWO issues:

1. **Missing setState() after hashtags load** (FIXED)
   - Line 86 in explore_screen.dart said "No setState needed" but that was wrong
   - Builder widget doesn't auto-rebuild when service data changes
   - Added `setState(() {})` after hashtags finish loading

2. **Firebase Analytics Blocking UI** (NOT YET FIXED)
   - ExploreScreen creates `Screen AnalyticsService()` in initState (line 41)
   - This requires Firebase to be initialized
   - Tests fail with "No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created"
   - If Firebase.initializeApp() is slow in production, it could block hashtag display

Next steps:
- Need to verify if Firebase init is blocking in production
- Consider making analytics services lazy-loaded or non-blocking
- Tests need Firebase mock or analytics service should handle missing Firebase gracefully

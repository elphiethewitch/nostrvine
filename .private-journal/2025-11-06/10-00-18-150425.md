## Project Notes

## Report Button and Circular Backgrounds Fix

**Problem**: 
1. Report button just opened share menu (wrong - should open report dialog directly)
2. All action icons lacked semi-transparent circular backgrounds for visibility

**Root Cause**:
- Report button called `_showShareMenu()` instead of showing report dialog
- ReportContentDialog was private (`_ReportContentDialog`) so couldn't be called from video_feed_item
- No circular background containers wrapping the IconButtons

**Solution**:
1. Made ReportContentDialog public (renamed from _ReportContentDialog)
2. Report button now calls `showDialog(context: context, builder: (context) => ReportContentDialog(video: video))`
3. Created `_buildCircularIconButton` helper that wraps IconButton in Container with:
   - `BoxDecoration(color: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.3), shape: BoxShape.circle)`
4. Applied circular background to ALL action buttons: like, comment, share, report

**Pattern Learned**:
- Action buttons on video overlays need semi-transparent circular backgrounds for visibility over video content
- Dialogs should be public if they need to be called from multiple places
- Helper methods for consistent styling reduce code duplication

**Files Changed**:
- lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart - Made ReportContentDialog public
- lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart - Added circular backgrounds, direct report dialog call

**Commit**: c85f531 "feat(moderation): report button opens dialog directly + add circular backgrounds to all icons"

## Project Notes

Profile navigation complete fix (3 changes):
1. app_router.dart lines 159-171: Added `/profile/:npub` route
2. route_utils.dart lines 58-78: parseRoute returns null videoIndex for grid mode  
3. profile_screen_router.dart lines 122-136: 'me' redirect preserves null videoIndex, calls goProfileGrid vs goProfile appropriately

The flash Rabble saw was the grid briefly rendering before the broken redirect added /0 to URL and switched to video mode.

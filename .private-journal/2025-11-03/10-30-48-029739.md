## Project Notes

Grid metrics fix: The video grid was only showing originalLikes (archived Vine data) instead of combining with current Nostr likes. Fixed by watching socialProvider and adding socialState.likeCounts[video.id] to video.originalLikes, matching the pattern used in video_feed_item.dart. Key insight: VideoEvent stores ONLY archived Vine metrics (originalLikes, originalLoops, etc.), while SocialState tracks NEW Nostr activity (likeCounts map). Total metrics = original + new. Files modified: composable_video_grid.dart lines 198-239 and added social_providers import.

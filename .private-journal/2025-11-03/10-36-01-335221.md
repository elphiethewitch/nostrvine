## Project Notes

Video keep-playing bug: When clicking user profile from video feed, video continued playing because goProfile() defaulted to videoIndex=0, making activeVideoIdProvider think there's an active video. Fixed by creating goProfileGrid() that sets videoIndex=null for grid mode. Key insight: videoIndex=null triggers grid mode in active_video_provider.dart:82, returning no active video. Files: nav_extensions.dart (added goProfileGrid), video_feed_item.dart:512 (use goProfileGrid instead of goProfile).

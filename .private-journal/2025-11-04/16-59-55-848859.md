## Project Notes

**Navigation Architecture Insight**:

Our app uses GoRouter with ShellRoute for tab navigation. Key discovery:

- Each tab (home/explore/notifications/profile) has its own Navigator with a GlobalKey
- Some tabs have multiple routes (grid vs feed mode)
- We were incorrectly using the SAME ValueKey for related routes
- This caused Flutter to think two different route instances were the same widget

**Navigator Key vs Page Key**:
- Navigator keys (_homeKey, _exploreKey, etc.) - ONE per tab, shared across routes
- Page keys (st.pageKey) - UNIQUE per route, even within same tab

The fix ensures proper widget lifecycle management during navigation.

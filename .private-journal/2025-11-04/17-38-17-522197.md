## Project Notes

**Explore Screen Video Playback Fixed**

Issue: After merging Sebastian's ui-changes branch, videos stopped playing in Explore feed (worked fine in Home feed)

Root cause: GlobalKey duplication from having two routes for explore (`/explore` and `/explore/:index`) both using `_exploreKey`

Fix: Consolidated to single route `/explore/:index?` following the pattern used by other tabs

Location: mobile/lib/router/app_router.dart

Status: Fix applied, testing in progress

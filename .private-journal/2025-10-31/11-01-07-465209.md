## Project Notes

OpenVine platform priorities: (1) macOS desktop for development/debugging with full features, (2) iOS and Android for release, (3) Windows desktop as secondary target. Web/Chrome build is NOT USED - divine.video runs a separate React app. Always use `./run_dev.sh macos debug` for development, never Chrome. Build scripts: build_native.sh for iOS/macOS with proper CocoaPods sync.

## Project Notes

Stop-motion quick tap fix: The "no frame error" was caused by minSegmentDuration=100ms threshold discarding quick taps. Solution: when stopRecording() detects duration < 100ms, it waits for the remaining time before stopping, ensuring at least one frame is always captured. Implementation at vine_recording_controller.dart:995-1006. This enables stop-motion animation by allowing users to tap record button very quickly and get consistent single-frame captures. Uses Future.delayed() to wait for minimum duration, which is acceptable here because it's ensuring video frames are captured, not arbitrary timing.

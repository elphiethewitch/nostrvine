## Project Notes

ProofMode initialization implementation verified and complete. Fixed the bug where ProofMode services were never initialized - now ensureInitialized() is called before first recording session. Implementation adds minimal delay (1-3s first time, <200ms after) and follows lazy initialization pattern. All files verified: proofmode_session_service.dart has the ensureInitialized() method, vine_recording_controller.dart calls it before starting ProofMode session, badge_explanation_modal.dart uses correct "authentic" language. Flutter analyze shows zero ProofMode-related errors (all 107 issues are pre-existing in unrelated files).

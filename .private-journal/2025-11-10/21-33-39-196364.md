## Project Notes

## Apple UGC Compliance Implementation Complete (Nov 10, 2025)

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Updated report relay from `wss://localhost:8080` to `wss://relay.divine.video` in content_reporting_service.dart:102
2. ✅ Added 24-hour moderation policy text to ReportContentDialog (share_video_menu.dart:1753-1759)
3. ✅ Added Safety & Privacy link to Settings screen (settings_screen.dart:141-152)
4. ✅ Created CONTENT_MODERATION_POLICY.md documentation

**Apple Requirement Status:**
- ✅ Method for filtering objectionable content: ContentModerationService, ContentBlocklistService
- ✅ Mechanism to report offensive content: ContentReportingService (NIP-56), ReportContentDialog
- ✅ Ability to block abusive users: Block/Unblock in video menu
- ✅ 24-hour response commitment: Displayed in report dialog, documented in policy
- ✅ Published contact information: contact@divine.video in multiple locations

**Critical Implementation Details:**
- Reports publish to relay.divine.video as kind 1984 events (NIP-56)
- Policy text states: "Divine will act on content reports within 24 hours by removing the content and ejecting the user who provided the offending content"
- Safety Settings accessible from Settings > Safety & Privacy
- Contact email: contact@divine.video (bug_report_config.dart:20)

**Files Modified:**
1. lib/services/content_reporting_service.dart (relay URL)
2. lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart (24-hour policy text)
3. lib/screens/settings_screen.dart (Safety Settings link + import)

**No Errors:** flutter analyze shows only errors in test/old_files (not production code)

**Next Steps for Rabble:**
- Set up backend monitoring of relay.divine.video for kind 1984 events
- Establish moderation team workflow
- Configure relay event deletion capability
- Test end-to-end reporting flow

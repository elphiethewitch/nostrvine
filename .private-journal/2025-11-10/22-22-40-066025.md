## Project Notes

IMPORTANT: Rabble wants seed data to include Editor's Pick list.

**What this means:**
- Editor's Pick is likely a NIP-51 list event (kind 30000 or 30001)
- Contains curated video event IDs
- We need to:
  1. Query for the Editor's Pick list event from relay.divine.video
  2. Extract video IDs from the list
  3. Query for those specific videos
  4. Include the list event itself in seed data
  5. Include all videos referenced by the list

**Updated seed data structure:**
- Editor's Pick list event (kind 30000/30001)
- Videos from Editor's Pick list (top priority)
- Top popular videos by loop count (fill remainder to reach 250 total)
- Author profiles for all videos
- Total: ~500 events

This ensures first-launch users see curated content immediately.

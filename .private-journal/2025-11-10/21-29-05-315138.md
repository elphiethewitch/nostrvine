## Project Notes

## Apple App Store UGC Compliance Audit (Nov 10, 2025)

**Apple's Requirements for User-Generated Content Apps:**

1. ✅ **Method for filtering objectionable content**
   - ContentModerationService (lib/services/content_moderation_service.dart)
   - ContentBlocklistService (lib/services/content_blocklist_service.dart)
   - MuteListService integration with NIP-51
   - Client-side filtering of blocked users and muted content

2. ✅ **Mechanism to report offensive content**
   - ContentReportingService (lib/services/content_reporting_service.dart)
   - NIP-56 compliant reporting (kind 1984 events)
   - ReportContentDialog UI in share_video_menu.dart
   - Reports sent to divine moderation relay (wss://relay3.openvine.co)
   - Multiple report reasons: spam, harassment, violence, sexual content, copyright, misinformation, CSAM, AI-generated

3. ✅ **Ability to block abusive users**
   - Block/Unblock UI in share_video_menu.dart (lines 869-921)
   - ContentBlocklistService.blockUser() method
   - Blocked users filtered from all feeds (home, explore, hashtag)
   - Users can still explicitly visit blocked profiles

4. ❓ **Timely responses to concerns (24-hour requirement)**
   - **CRITICAL GAP**: Need backend monitoring and response system
   - Reports are published to relay but no automated monitoring mentioned
   - Need to verify: Who monitors wss://relay3.openvine.co for reports?
   - Need to verify: Is there a 24-hour response SLA in place?
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Document moderation workflow and response times

5. ✅ **Published contact information**
   - Need to verify settings screen has contact info
   - Bug report system exists (bug_report_service.dart)

**Additional Apple Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Safety Settings Screen (lib/screens/safety_settings_screen.dart)
- ✅ Multiple content filtering reasons
- ✅ Decentralized architecture (NIP-51, NIP-56 compliant)

**CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAP:**
The 24-hour response requirement is the most critical Apple requirement. Need to verify:
1. Is there a backend system monitoring reports from wss://relay3.openvine.co?
2. Is there a documented process for responding within 24 hours?
3. Is there a way to remove offending content and eject users?

**Contact Information Verification Needed:**
- Check Settings screen for developer contact info
- Check App Store metadata for support URLs

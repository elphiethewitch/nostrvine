## Project Notes

Feature idea: Bundle starter content (10 popular vines + editor's picks) into app

Architecture considerations:
- Need to balance app size vs UX (videos are large)
- Could bundle video files in assets/bundled_videos/
- Store corresponding Nostr events as JSON in assets/bundled_events.json
- On first launch, seed embedded relay database with bundled events
- Video files would need URL mapping (bundled:// scheme or similar)

Questions to clarify with Rabble:
1. What's acceptable app size increase? (10 videos could be 50-100MB)
2. Should bundled content persist or be replaced by network content?
3. Do we want to update bundled content with app updates?
4. Should bundled videos appear in discovery/home feeds or separate "Featured" section?

Related files to investigate:
- mobile/lib/services/video_event_service.dart - where to inject bundled events
- mobile/lib/services/embedded_nostr_relay.dart - could pre-seed database
- mobile/lib/providers/video_events_providers.dart - how to merge bundled + network content

## Project Notes

OpenVine seed preload architecture: SQL events go to Drift DB (Task 2 done), bundled media files need to go to flutter_cache_manager cache (Task 3c). Need to understand VideoCacheManager's cache directory structure and how to register pre-cached files so they're recognized without network fetch. Should follow same pattern as SeedDataPreloadService: check if already populated, non-critical error handling, integrate into startup.

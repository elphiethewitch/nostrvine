## Project Notes

TODO: Implement video caching strategy

Current state unclear - need to check:
- mobile/lib/widgets/video_player_widget.dart or similar
- How videos are currently loaded (direct streaming vs download?)
- Any existing cache implementation

Proposed architecture:
VideoLoadingService with priority:
1. Check bundled assets (bundled://)
2. Check local cache (by video hash/ID)
3. Download from Blossom server + cache locally
4. Serve from cache on subsequent loads

Need to use proper cache directory (getApplicationCacheDirectory) and implement cache size limits/eviction policy.
